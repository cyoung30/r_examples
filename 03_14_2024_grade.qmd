###Grades reflection March 14
I think I ought to get a B- or lower. That might seem low, but I feel like I have not put in the proper amount of work the past few weeks. I mean to use my Costa Rica lichen project for my main workflowr visual, but since I have gotten far behind on that, I have nothing much to work with in workflowr, which has really stagnated. Since I finally have some time to clean and analyze the rest of my datasets, I'll get back into the flow of things and hopefully make up for what I missed, but I don't want to give myself a grade for work I haven't done yet.

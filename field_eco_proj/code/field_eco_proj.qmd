## Field Ecology 2024 Project

trying to make a nice plot on lichen data for my field ecology course!

vars: substrate (stem) diameter where lichen grows; surface area of lichen

substrate_diameter measured with calipers, surface_area measured with imageJ

working off of <https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/#prep> (but relying heavily on ChatGPT for questions)

```{r}
## load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

## load lichen data from excel. do i need to save it as a csv? did it anyway
lichen_data <- read_excel("/Users/carteryoung/Desktop/cr/FULL_coenogonium.xlsx")
write.csv(lichen_data, "lichen.csv", row.names = FALSE)
## head to check it
head(lichen_data, 10)


## make a plot!
(g <- ggplot(lichen_data, aes(x = `Substrate_Diameter`, y = `Surface_Area`)))
## why's it got x and y labels and no numbers?
## asked ChatGPT and it told me I needed to put in the vars. names as `name_name` instead of the usual quotes. works now!

## adding points
g + geom_point(aes(color = "darkolivegreen3", shape = "diamond"), size = 2)
## that is neither darkolivegreen or a diamond! moving on anyway

## adding linear regression, fixed earlier problems w/ color
## looks nicer when indented...
g + geom_point(aes(x = `Substrate_Diameter`, y = `Surface_Area`), 
               shape = "diamond", 
               color = "darkolivegreen3", 
               size = 2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

```

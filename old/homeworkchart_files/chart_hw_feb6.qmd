boxplot from r-graph-gallery "most basic boxplot"

```{r}
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
 
#Basic boxplot with mock lichen data from Costa Rica field ecology course
#Probably not the correct analysis to use but I felt like boxplots
#practiced importing data from excel. Need to keep variables capitalized the same way or else they'll be a weird new column
#practiced GGplot2 in R... doesn't feel to different from base?
ggplot(chart_test, aes(x=as.factor(Size), y=SubstrateDiameter)) + 
    geom_boxplot(fill="green", alpha=0.2) + 
    xlab("Size")
```
